        “It isn't necessary for a work to have a lot of things to look at, to compare,
        to analyze one by one, to contemplate. The thing as a whole, its quality whole, is what
        is interesting. The main things are alone and are more intense, clear and powerful."
        <br>—Donald Judd

        <br>QUESTION
        What can you produce over 100 days?
        </p>

        <p>
        <br>BACKGROUND
        But what do you do when you don't have anything to work with? Just stay in bed? Writers have this figured out:
        it's amazing how many of them have a rigid routine. John Cheever, for instance, used to wake up every morning
        in his New York City apartment, put on a jacket and tie, kiss his wife goodbye, and take the elevator down
        to his apartment building's basement, when he would sit at a small desk and write until quitting time, at which
        point he'd go back up.
